# ML-catalogue

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation used in a university project that analyzes how machine learning is applied in product development and production, based on large-scale analysis of scientific article abstracts.

The study uses an exploratory methodology and treats abstracts as a consistent and scalable unit of analysis. A combination of rule-based methods, weakly supervised text classification, semantic embeddings, and unsupervised clustering is used to characterize machine learning applications across multiple dimensions, including learning paradigms, product lifecycle phases, application contexts, and mentioned ML methods.

The repository documents the full workflow from data collection and preprocessing to classification and analysis.
