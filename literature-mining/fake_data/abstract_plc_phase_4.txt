Industrial hydraulic systems used in construction and mining equipment often experience harsh operational conditions that accelerate component wear and lead to costly downtime. 
This paper presents a data-driven framework that supports both in-service maintenance decisions and reuse of components at the end of their primary lifecycle.
Sensor data including pressure fluctuations, temperature gradients, vibration profiles, and fluid contamination levels are continuously collected from equipment deployed in the field. 
A hybrid machine learning model combines physics-based degradation features with historical service records to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as pumps and actuators.

The RUL estimates are used to optimize maintenance scheduling to prevent unexpected failures while maximizing equipment availability.
When components are removed from service, the system evaluates their residual performance potential to determine suitability for refurbishment or secondary deployment. 
Materials and parts that no longer satisfy reuse criteria are directed to recycling processes, where traceability records help ensure proper recovery of valuable alloys.

A multi-site validation study was conducted on a fleet of 120 excavators operating across different climate zones. 
Results show a 27% reduction in unplanned failures, extended utilization of reusable parts by up to 18%, and a measurable decrease in raw material demand. 
Feedback from field operations is fed back to design teams to improve future component lifetimes and support circular product strategies. 
This research demonstrates that leveraging real-world usage data not only improves service quality but also enables more sustainable product lifecycle management through informed reuse and end-of-life decisions.
