Commissioning of new automated assembly lines often requires extensive manual tuning of machine parameters to achieve stable process conditions before full-scale production can begin. 
This paper presents a machine learning–based methodology to support parameter setup during production deployment of a new electronics assembly system. 
The case study focuses on the integration of high-precision screwdriving stations used for fastening structural components in consumer devices. 
Initial torque, rotational speed, and press-fit tolerance parameters are difficult to define manually due to varying material properties and part-to-part variations.
A supervised learning model is developed using data collected from controlled pilot runs, including sensor measurements from torque drivers, part geometry data, and intermediate quality inspection results. 
The model predicts optimal parameter settings that ensure assembly consistency and reduce the likelihood of fastening defects. 
The recommended parameters are automatically uploaded to the station controller and evaluated through short validation runs monitored by built-in machine feedback systems.
Compared to conventional trial-and-error tuning performed by commissioning engineers, the ML-assisted setup reduces the number of adjustment cycles required to reach a stable baseline configuration. 
Experimental results from deployment on the industrial pilot line show a 40% reduction in commissioning time, fewer rejects during ramp-up, and smoother transition into volume production. 
The study demonstrates that integrating machine learning into early production setup activities can accelerate deployment of new manufacturing processes and reduce dependency on manual expertise. 
The approach supports faster realization of production capacity while ensuring conformance to engineering specifications from the start of manufacturing.
