Manufacturers face increasing pressure to deliver new products that meet emerging customer expectations, sustainability goals, and financial constraints long before physical production begins. 
This paper presents a framework for early-stage decision support that integrates market requirement analysis with virtual evaluation of conceptual production system designs.
The approach starts with identifying functional needs through customer interviews, benchmarking, and demand forecasting. Based on these requirements, 
several feasible product and manufacturing concepts are generated and represented in a digital planning environment. 
Each concept is assessed with respect to projected costs, carbon footprint, and expected production capacity by means of scenario-based simulations. 
Risk analysis is implemented to evaluate uncertainties such as volatile demand, supply chain disruptions, and resource availability. 
A multi-criteria decision model combines all planning factors into a quantitative score that enables systematic comparison and prioritization of product–process alternatives. 
A case study from the consumer electronics sector is used to demonstrate how early virtual planning can reveal potential bottlenecks and investment challenges well before detailed engineering begins. 
Results show that integrating market insights, sustainability constraints, and production feasibility into conceptual planning provides stronger guidance for design targets, 
reduces late-stage redesigns, and improves confidence in strategic manufacturing decisions. 
The study concludes that planning activities performed prior to detailed design are critical for aligning innovation with future production capabilities and long-term business objectives.
