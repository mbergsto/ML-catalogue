Once an automated welding line is fully deployed and operating at stable production levels, equipment degradation and process variability can gradually affect weld quality. 
This study proposes a real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance framework designed to continuously improve reliability and reduce scrap rates in a high-volume production environment. 
The methodology collects multimodal data streams from the welding stations, including electrical current signatures, electrode force measurements, and thermal imaging of the weld zone. 
Historical records of part inspection results and maintenance logs are used to train machine learning models capable of linking parameter deviations with downstream quality issues.

A stacked ensemble of deep autoencoders and random forest classifiers detects early signs of process drift and estimates the remaining useful life of consumable components such as electrodes. 
When anomaly scores exceed defined thresholds, the system recommends proactive maintenance interventions with minimum disruption to production. 
Real-time dashboards allow operators to monitor process health and view predictive maintenance alerts directly at the line.

Industrial evaluation conducted over a 10-week period in automotive chassis production demonstrates a 35% reduction in defect rates and a 22% decrease in unplanned downtime. 
Additionally, maintenance activities were rescheduled to off-peak periods, leading to more efficient labor utilization. 
These results highlight that continuous monitoring and data-driven optimization strategies substantially enhance long-term stability and productivity of automated welding operations. 
The work shows that leveraging operational data after process maturity is essential for ongoing improvement, enabling manufacturing systems to maintain high performance throughout their lifecycle.
