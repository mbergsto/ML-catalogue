10.12454/j.jsuese.202400014,supervised,sichuan university all rights reservedobjective the vacuum degassing vd furnace is an essential piece of equipment for producing highquality steel unlike other furnaces the vd furnace lacks a heating function leading to a significant drop in the temperature of molten steel during the refining process if the refining endpoint temperature of molten steel is excessively high it results in energy waste and can even disrupt the continuous casting process if the endpoint temperature is too low the molten steel must be reheated in the ladle furnace lf severely impacting production efficiency therefore the refining endpoint temperature significantly influences the quality of molten steel production efficiency and continuous casting in recent years adopting new technologies such as machine learning and big data has become crucial for transforming and upgrading steelmaking plants facilitating the shift towards intelligent manufacturing this study proposes a method that combines metallurgical mechanism analysis data analysis and machine learning to develop a temperature prediction model for vd furnace refining methods initially the key factors influencing the endpoint temperature of molten steel are identified through metallurgical mechanism analysis of the vd furnace then production data from the steelmaking plant are processed following operational procedures to eliminate missing and abnormal data the principle is applied to preprocess the actual production data removing outliers to improve data quality and ensure the accuracy of subsequent model training and prediction pearson correlation analysis is then employed to discard factors with a minor impact on the molten steel temperature helping to determine the input variables for the prediction model the dataset is randomly shuffled with selected as the training set and the remaining as the testing set following this based on metallurgical mechanism mm analysis the initial feature importance in the input variables of the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model is partially amplified finally the models prediction accuracy is further enhanced by optimizing the hyperparameters of xgboost through bayesian optimization bo algorithms resulting in the development of mmboxgboost models results and discussions this study employs grid search gs and random search rs for hyperparameter optimization of the model to compare the results to bo hyperparameter optimization the prediction of molten steel temperature is performed using the metallurgical mechanism model multiple linear regression model and backpropagation neural network model as comparisons demonstrating the superior performance of the mmboxgboost model the results indicated that bo hyperparameter optimization is the most effective providing the model with the best performance and higher prediction accuracy than the other two optimization algorithms in addition this model also exhibits good training efficiency with the training time being slightly higher than rs and significantly shorter than that of gs the optimal hyperparameter combination is determined to be maxdepth learningrate nestimators with a model training time of seconds the fluctuations in the actual vd furnace refining endpoint molten steel temperature similarly impact the prediction errors of the mmboxgboost model and the other three existing models among the heats with endpoint molten steel temperatures below the mechanistic model predicts more heats with high molten steel temperature values while the other three models predict fewer such heats however when the endpoint prediction temperature of molten steel exceeds the prediction accuracy of the mechanistic model diminishes with many heats having prediction errors exceeding and a greater number exceeding the mmboxgboost model performs best achieving the highest r of the lowest rmse of and the lowest mae of the hit ratios of this model are and for ranges of and respectively the mmboxgboost model demonstrates excellent training efficiency and prediction performance conclusion the analysis of the mechanism of the vd furnace refining process and pearson correlation analysis are conducted and the input variables for the prediction model of vd furnace endpoint liquid steel temperature are identified following the metallurgical mechanism the characteristic importance of xgboost input variables is partially enhanced and the models hyperparameters are optimized using bayesian optimization therefore the mmboxgboost model is developed with strong applicability and high accuracy this model is practical for precisely controlling molten steel temperature at the end of the vd furnace ensuring continuous casting progression and enhancing production efficiency the input variables for the mmboxgboost model are identified as follows initial temperature of molten steel amount of calcium wire added high vacuum holding time amount of aluminum wire added static stirring time feeding time after vacuum break vacuum degree weight of molten steel vacuum pumping time argon gas flow during vacuum pumping argon gas flow during high vacuum maintenance and ladle arrival waiting time the mmboxgboost model exhibits the best prediction performance of hyperparameters obtained through the bayesian optimization algorithm compared to the traditional metallurgical mechanism multiple linear regression and bp neural network models the mmboxgboost model in this study shows the best prediction effect
