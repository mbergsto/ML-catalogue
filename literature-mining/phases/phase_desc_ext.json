{
  "phase_1": {
    "name": "Planning",
    "description": "Research and activities before detailed design or production setup. Focus on defining needs, feasibility, and strategic decisions: customer and market requirement analysis, early concept generation and evaluation (e.g., simulation or virtual prototypes), risk and cost assessment, and high-level planning of production capacity, resources, and supply chains."
  },
  "phase_2": {
    "name": "Development_Production",
    "description": "Designing products and implementing production systems. Includes detailed engineering, prototyping and validation, process planning and automation setup, material and component selection, manufacturability improvements, as well as establishing and controlling production lines or pilot manufacturing environments."
  },
  "phase_3": {
    "name": "Optimization",
    "description": "Continuous improvement of established products or production processes using operational data. Encompasses process monitoring, performance analysis, anomaly and failure detection, predictive maintenance, quality improvement, and parameter or control optimization based on machine, sensor, and production data."
  },
  "phase_4": {
    "name": "Use_Reuse",
    "description": "Focus on products in operation or at end-of-life. Activities include field data collection on performance and user behavior, service and maintenance, remaining useful life estimation, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, recycling and circular strategies, and feeding operational insights back to design and production."
